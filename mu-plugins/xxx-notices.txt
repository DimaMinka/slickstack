<div class="notice notice-warning">
<p><strong>May 22, 2019:</strong> We've blacklisted the <code>yith-woocommerce-stripe</code> plugin after several months of warnings due to poor coding and certain features being locked behind a secondary API. The official Stripe plugin for WooCommerce has been free for over a year already, there is no reason to use another one at this point. Payment processing has many security and legal concerns, and you should always use the "official" plugin whenever possible. Due to multiple issues with malware, exploits, thrashing, and careless releases, we highly recommend avoiding YITH products.</p>

<p><strong>May 21, 2019:</strong> We've blacklisted the <code>wp-live-chat-support</code> plugin due to malware, and it has also been removed from WordPress.org.</p>

<p><strong>May 16, 2019:</strong> We've blacklisted the <code>woocommerce-wholesale-prices</code> plugin due to database thrashing, and are in touch with the plugin author, Rymera Web. We recommend checking out an alternative plugin from <a href="https://ignitewoo.com/woocommerce-extensions-plugins-themes/woocommerce-wholesale-pricing/" target="_blank">IgniteWoo</a>.</p>

<p>To view a list of disallowed plugins, along with vendors that we do (and do not) recommend, please bookmark <a href="http://mirrors.slickstack.io/wordpress/blacklist.txt" target="_blank">this blacklist file.</a></p>
