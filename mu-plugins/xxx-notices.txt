<div class="notice notice-warning">
<p><strong>June 5, 2019:</strong> We've blacklisted the <code>google-analytics-dashboard-for-wp</code> plugin due to serious JS conflicts that were preventing caches from being cleared, and certain WordPress Core functions from working. The plugin had been listed for future blacklisting for several months already due to severely bloated code and embedded tracking (spyware). Although viewing analytics in your WP Admin Dashboard can be enjoyable, keep in mind these types of plugins slow down your backend drastically and have lots of potential JS conflicts and security issues. It's always best to use an extremely lightweight Google Analytics plugin like the <a href="https://github.com/littlebizzy/google-analytics/archive/1.0.7.zip" target="_blank">free one from LittleBizzy</a> that loads a very small GA script in your site footer (only). There are a few other "in dashboard" analytics plugins that we have not blacklisted (yet) but we highly recommend not using them for these reasons.</p>

<p>To view a list of disallowed plugins, along with vendors that we do (and do not) recommend, please bookmark <a href="http://mirrors.slickstack.io/wordpress/blacklist.txt" target="_blank">this blacklist file.</a></p>
