<div class="notice notice-warning">
<p><strong>Apr 21, 2019:</strong> We've blacklisted the <code>wp-live-chat-support</code> plugin due to malware, and it has also been removed from WordPress.org.</p>

<p><strong>May 16, 2019:</strong> We've blacklisted the <code>woocommerce-wholesale-prices</code> plugin due to database thrashing and poor coding, and are in touch with the plugin author, Rymera Web, about how to improve their codebase. In the meanwhile we recommend checking out an alternative plugin from <a href="https://ignitewoo.com/woocommerce-extensions-plugins-themes/woocommerce-wholesale-pricing/" target="_blank">IgniteWoo</a>.</p>

<p>To view a list of blacklisted plugins, along with vendors that we do (and do not) recommend, please bookmark <a href="http://mirrors.slickstack.io/wordpress/blacklist.txt" target="_blank">this blacklist file.</a></p>
