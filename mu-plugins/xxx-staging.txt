    <p><strong>Staging Site:</strong> You are now browsing a temporary staging site. Please use this site to briefly test new plugins, themes, or features (and not for long-term web design work). To avoid conflicts and database bloat, it is best to not push your staging database to your production (live) site, and instead use this site for testing purposes only. However, if you do push your staging site live, keep in mind that only Plugins, Themes, and the wp_options table will be synced, and nothing else (this process will overwrite the Plugins, Themes, and wp_options table on your live site). If one of your plugins or themes is improperly using the /uploads/ directory to store critical files, THESE WILL BE IGNORED WHEN PUSHING STAGING TO LIVE.</p>
